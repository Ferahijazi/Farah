<p>My name is Farah. I grew up in Amman, Jordan and Iâ€™m currently based in Amsterdam, Netherlands. I have an eclectic background with special interest in concepts concerning self-other relations and their interaction with the environment. During my BA in Interior Design, I developed an interest in environmental psychology and lighting design. Having had the chance to do an MA in Media Art Histories allowed me to cultivate the theoretical and analytical perspective on media art installations. For my thesis, I focused on analyzing installations that are shaped around one-on-one interactions in an exploration of notions of empathy. More critically, it made me aware of the emancipatory potential that installation art holds.</p>
