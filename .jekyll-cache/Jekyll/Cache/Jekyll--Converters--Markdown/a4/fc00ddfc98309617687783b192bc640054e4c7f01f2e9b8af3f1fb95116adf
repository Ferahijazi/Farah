I"d<p><strong>Defining Goals</strong> :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make a PCB board using Kicad</li>
  <li>Play around with the design to make it something expressive</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>After watching the video from the electronics design week and getting familiarized a little bit with the different components and what they do.</p>

<p><strong>Some of the components mentioned</strong> :</p>

<p>Ribbon Cable (wires in a ribbon) and is graded by what is called <strong>AWG</strong> which refers to the gauge of the diameter. Gauge is a measure of the size of a wire which correlates with how much current you can put through the wire.</p>
