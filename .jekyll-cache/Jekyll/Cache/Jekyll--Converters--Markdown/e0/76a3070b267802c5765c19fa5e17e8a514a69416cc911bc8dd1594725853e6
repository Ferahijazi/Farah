<ul>
  <li>Parametric design and making things simpler 
<img src="/images/parametric.png" alt="" />
<em>I started with a few ones and add more during the design process</em></li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>I started off with assigning the paramters using changeÂ Â» modify parameters</li>
</ol>

<p>What went wrong? I intended to simplify the process by preparing the measrements in a parametric way, yet it did not work according to plan. What I missed was assigning a specific shape to the measerements and then using the rectangular pattern in oder to automise the process for the rest of the repeated patterns.</p>

<p>Also, I forgot to do this step in the beginning. Creating a component in the beginning for each piece</p>

<p><img src="/images/Create_Component.png" alt="" />
<em>Rename the component to the assigned piece, i.e. Lower Side of the Box!</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I drew the main parts using the sketch command. For instance : Choose, Top view plane, sketch and assign each line to its paramter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Extend to thickness parameter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Repeat process for all the sides of the box!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tricky part! Adding the joints.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>One way to go about it is to re-edit the sketches. For instance: the Lower Side sketch.</p>

<ul>
  <li>First draw a line</li>
  <li>Assign the thickness parameter between it and the edge of your rectangular! repeat process on all sides!</li>
  <li>Draw a small line between the bottom and the left side, width wise, stick to the thickness, length wise according to the spacing you will have! For instance 1 cm, make sure this is done through an assigned parameter.</li>
  <li>Use the rectangular pattern to repeat the process for those linesâ€¦ choose direction of your pattern, how many repeats and specify the measurements</li>
</ul>
