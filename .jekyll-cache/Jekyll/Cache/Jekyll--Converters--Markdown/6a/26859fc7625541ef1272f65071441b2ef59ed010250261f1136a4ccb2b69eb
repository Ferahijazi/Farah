I"-<p>For this week, I dedicated my time to watching a lot of tutorials, as I set out my learning goals to learn a little bit of blender and fusion 360. As a design goal, I wanted to do a bit of research on biomimicry, <em>Biomimicry in Architecture</em> by Micheal Pawlyn (2011) p. 38-43 and got inspired by trees.</p>

<p>I watched this course on LinkedIn Learning</p>

<p>Some gathered tips:</p>

<p>Ways of Planning Your Design</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Inside Out - like lego, building blocks, you build on top of it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Outside In - like a sculpture, block of clay, carve away final shape from their starting profile.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before starting off with a design, taking measurements of the object you would like to model is crucial. A Digital Caliper can help you with precise measurements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sketch on paper and insert the sketch as a reference for your model.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Hazel &amp; I prepared some molds by cutting and melting blocks of acrylic then putting them inside containers</p>

<p>Going through last year’s fab academy documentation, I really liked this tutorial using Cuttle
<a href="https://fabacademy.org/2021/labs/waag/students/nadieh-bremer/blog/week-3/">https://fabacademy.org/2021/labs/waag/students/nadieh-bremer/blog/week-3/</a></p>

<p>It looks cool because it allows you to prepare complex geometric shapes easily for the laser cutter, it’s online and for free!</p>
