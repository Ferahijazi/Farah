I"<p><strong>Defining Goals</strong> :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make a PCB board using Kicad</li>
  <li>Play around with the design to make it something expressive</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>After watching the video from the electronics design week and getting familiarized a little bit with the different <strong>components</strong> and what they do.</p>

<p><strong>Some of the components mentioned</strong> :</p>

<p><strong>Ribbon Cable</strong> (wires in a ribbon) and is graded by what is called <strong>AWG</strong> which refers to the gauge of the diameter. Gauge is a measure of the size of a wire which correlates with how much current you can put through the wire.</p>

<p><strong>IDC Connector</strong></p>

<p><strong>Slide Switch</strong> can be used as a configuration switch or a low power switch. 
<strong>Resistor</strong> used for limiting the flow of current
<strong>capacitor</strong> used for local charge storage
<strong>Polarized capacitors</strong> is a component that is been a capacitor and a battery, they can store large amounts of power
<strong>Crystal/Resonator</strong> are used to determine time. Mainly used to determine high resolution timing/high accuracy
<strong>Inductor</strong> when a current flows through it, it creates a magnetic field
<strong>Diods</strong> the current can go only in one direction. There are two sides to the diod, one is called anode and the other cathode
<strong>LEDs</strong> are a particular kind of diod. LEDs have a particular indication for direction. For instance, if you see a green line on one side and it is on the cathode side. You always use an LED with a current limiting resistor and the resistor will determine how bright the LED is going to be
<strong>Transistor</strong> there are bipolar ones, which we are not going to use. Mosfits are one of the key components in the class, there is a P mosift (source of current) and an N mosfit(sink of current). There is a drain and a source on one side and the gate on the other. RDS is the resistence between the drain and the source. Both are used to control things that take a lot of current like motors or speakers.
<strong>Regulators</strong> are regulated by current input voltage and output voltage. You need a capacitor on the right side
<strong>Amplifiers</strong> are now built into the processor, you can pick them in software and you donâ€™t need a seperate component.
<strong>Micro-controllers</strong> are a world of their own, there is so much to cover and learn about.</p>
