I"Á<p>I began with watching an introduction to what electrcity is, how it works and what units are important to understand.</p>

<h3 id="some-basics">Some basics:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Electricity is the type of energy that can be built up in one place or flow from one place to another</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Static electric charges is energy gathered in one place.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Current electricity</em> is energy that flows from one place to another.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Current</em> is the form of electricity which makes all our electronic gadgets work, when charges are able to constantly flow, dynamic, charges are always on the move.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>DC current : the flow of electrons stays in the same direction and the voltage stays the same.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>AC current</em> : the flow of electrons changes &amp; the voltage does not stay the same</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Voltage</em> is a force which makes electrons move through a wire.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<em>Electricity Introduction</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Voltage <em>V</em></li>
  <li>Current <em>A</em> or <em>I</em></li>
  <li>Resistance <em>ohms</em></li>
</ul>

<p>V = I * R
R = V/I
I = V/R</p>

<p><img src="/images/types_of_resistance.png" alt="" />
<em>Resistance can be formed in series or in parallel</em></p>

<h4 id="input-devices--sensors">Input Devices &amp; Sensors</h4>

<p>A sensor basically gives data to the arduino, it gives information to the controller by changing its voltage</p>

<hr />

<p>Some examples</p>

<p><img src="/images/Pontimeter.png" alt="" />
<em>Rotatory Potentiometer: This device would change the resistance it offers if we rotate the knob clockwise or anti-clocwise</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/Momentary Push Button.png" alt="" />
<em>Momentary Push Button Switch: When we press the switch it will close the circuit and when we release the switch it will open the circuit</em></p>

<em>Touch Sensor</em>
<em>Rotary Encoder</em>
<em>Ultrasonic Distance Sensor</em>
<em>Infrared Sensor</em>
<em>Temp &amp; Humidity Sensor</em>
<em>Light Dependant Resistor</em></p>

<h3 id="bits-and-bytes">Bits and Bytes</h3>

<p><img src="/images/calculatingbits.png" alt="" />
<em>Calculting bits</em></p>

<p>*A bit can store 0 or 1 inside one memory box
*8 bits form a byte</p>
<ul>
  <li>We can only store value up to the upper limit of that space
<em>Need to research a bit on binary math ro understand it a bit better</em></li>
  <li>In order to calculate how many bits are needed, we multiply by 2</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 id="arduino-programming">Arduino Programming</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Arduino programming uses a mixture of c and c++</li>
  <li>Arduino makers call it wiring</li>
  <li>Setup and Loop</li>
  <li>Built in functions</li>
  <li>what digitalWrite means is replace the built in function with a certain pin on the arduino board, n.13 for instance
manipulating digital pins through inbuilt functions
Low means 0 voltages which mean light off and high means 5 voltages which means ligh on
*Variables, declared before setup</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>Serial.begin(9600) enables communication between arduino and computer</li>
  <li>Serial.println will add an additional line after printing</li>
  <li>Increment (pre and post) for example myVariable++ instead of ++myVariable
The difference is either use the increment then declare it or the opposite of declare then use</li>
  <li>Decrement is using - myVariableâ€“</li>
  <li>int, float already familiar with them</li>
  <li>Note about bool : 1 or HIGH true holds the same value, any other number aside from 0 will be converted to 1, 0 or LOW or false holds the same value</li>
  <li>byte can store 8 bits of data, a byte is just like an int and the range is from 0 to 255, if byte is declared without a value it will initialize it as 0</li>
  <li>char is for characters, declaring one character, each character holds a certain value in numbers</li>
</ul>

<p>#### Variable Scope &amp; Qualifiers</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scope</li>
  <li>
    <p>Two types of variables : Global and local, already familiar with this, just note that if you declare a local varibale in void setup() you can also declae it again in void loop() with a different value</p>
  </li>
  <li>Qualifiers define additional behavior to our variables, constant and static typesâ€¦ const keyword means its ready only, can be used as any other variable of its type but its value cannot be changed</li>
  <li>you can use hash define instead of const, it doesnâ€™t use any memory in arduino  yet it has some downsides as the compiler will replace all the references to pi in the code and you will start facing problems
 *Static Qualifier will initialize a value locally only one time, for instance if declared inside void loop then it will only read it once static int fish = 0;</li>
</ul>
