**Defining Goals** :

* Make a PCB board using Kicad
* Play around with the design to make it something expressive

---

After watching the video from the electronics design week and getting familiarized a little bit with the different **components** and what they do.

**Some of the components mentioned** :

* **Ribbon Cable** (wires in a ribbon) and is graded by what is called **AWG** which refers to the gauge of the diameter. Gauge is a measure of the size of a wire which correlates with how much current you can put through the wire.

* **IDC Connector**

* **Slide Switch** can be used as a configuration switch or a low power switch. 
* **Resistor** used for limiting the flow of current
* **Capacitor** used for local charge storage
* **Polarized capacitors** is a component that is been a capacitor and a battery, they can store large amounts of power
* **Crystal/Resonator** are used to determine time. Mainly used to determine high resolution timing/high accuracy
* **Inductor** when a current flows through it, it creates a magnetic field
* **Diods** the current can go only in one direction. There are two sides to the diod, one is called anode and the other cathode
* **LEDs** are a particular kind of diod. LEDs have a particular indication for direction. For instance, if you see a green line on one side and it is on the cathode side. You always use an LED with a current limiting resistor and the resistor will determine how bright the LED is going to be
* **Transistor** there are bipolar ones, which we are not going to use. Mosfits are one of the key components in the class, there is a P mosift (source of current) and an N mosfit(sink of current). There is a drain and a source on one side and the gate on the other. RDS is the resistence between the drain and the source. Both are used to control things that take a lot of current like motors or speakers.
* **Regulators** are regulated by current input voltage and output voltage. You need a capacitor on the right side
* **Amplifiers** are now built into the processor, you can pick them in software and you don't need a seperate component.
* **Micro-controllers** are a world of their own, there is so much to cover and learn about.

#### Steps :

* First, I installed the fab academy library which can be found on the electronics design week and added it to kicad.
