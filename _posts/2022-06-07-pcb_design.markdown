**Defining Goals** :

* Make a PCB board using Kicad
* Play around with the design to make it something expressive

After watching the video from the electronics design week and getting familiarized a little bit with the different components and what they do.

**Some of the components mentioned** :

Ribbon Cable (wires in a ribbon) and is graded by what is called **AWG**


First, I installed the fab academy library which can be found on the electronics design week and added to kicad.
