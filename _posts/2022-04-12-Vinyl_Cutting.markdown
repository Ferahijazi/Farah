* Adjust force and speed, you can also cut test to see if its ok, if not, apply more force if necessary, usually 50 is good but it depends on the thickness of the material

* Send file to print and you're done!

Keep in mind that origin placed on the left side works better!

Ironing your thermal vinyl sticker

* Turn on the machine
* Make sure there is baking paper on both sides
* Don't use material like zippers or buttons, fabric is okay
* Choose the right temperature for your material, use google to help and for the timing choose 20 seconds
* place your fabric and on top of it the thermal vinyl sticker between the baking sheets
* Press play
* lift the handle down when it beeps
* lift it back up after 20 minutes are done!
* and it's ready!
