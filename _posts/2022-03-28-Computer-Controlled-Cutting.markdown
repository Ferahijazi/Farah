### 3D SCANNING & PRINTING

We scanned our faces for fun! We used a program called Sense, you have to hold very still while being scanned.

* Once your face is there, you can make adjustments such as erase and trim and then press Solidify 

 * Finish and Export as an OBJ file 
 * Choose your filament + determine which printer you will be using depending on the size
 * Printer settings/configuration assistant, we chose  Prusa i3 MK3S & MK3S+ (0.4 mm nozzle) and Other vendors, choose Creality FFF & Ultimaker FFF
 * Import the file into PrusaSlicer on your laptop 
 * 
 * You can make necessary adjustments before slicing such as scaling and resizing, depending on what you're printing, you might need to paint on supports using the brush tool
