I began with watching an introduction to what electrcity is, how it works and what units are important to understand. 

### Some basics:

* Electricity is the type of energy that can be built up in one place or flow from one place to another

* Static electric charges is energy gathered in one place.

* *Current electricity* is energy that flows from one place to another.

* *Current* is the form of electricity which makes all our electronic gadgets work, when charges are able to constantly flow, dynamic, charges are always on the move. 

* DC current : the flow of electrons stays in the same direction and the voltage stays the same.

* *AC current* : the flow of electrons changes & the voltage does not stay the same 

* *Voltage* is a force which makes electrons move through a wire.

*Electricity Introduction*


* Voltage *V*
* Current *A* or *I*
* Resistance *ohms*

V = I * R
R = V/I
I = V/R

*Resistance can be formed in series or in parallel*

### Microprocessor & Microcontroller

* Microprocessor is known as the brain of any computer
---

##### IDE

---

##### Breadboard

---



#### Input Devices & Sensors 

A sensor basically give data to the arduino, it gives information to the controller by changing its voltage

Some examples

*Rotatory Potentiometer: This device would change the resistance it offers if we rotate the knob clockwise or anti-clocwise*

*Momentary Push Button Switch: When we press the switch it will close the circuit and when we release the switch it will open the circuit*

*Sound & Microphone Sensor*
*Touch Sensor*
*Rotary Encoder*
*Ultrasonic Distance Sensor*
*Infrared Sensor*
*Temp & Humidity Sensor*
*Light Dependant Resistor*
