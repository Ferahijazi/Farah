I began with watching an introduction to what electrcity is, how it works and what units are important to understand. 

### Some basics:

* Electricity is the type of energy that can be built up in one place or flow from one place to another

* Static electric charges is energy gathered in one place.

* *Current electricity* is energy that flows from one place to another.

* *Current* is the form of electricity which makes all our electronic gadgets work, when charges are able to constantly flow, dynamic, charges are always on the move. 

* DC current : the flow of electrons stays in the same direction and the voltage stays the same.

* *AC current* : the flow of electrons changes & the voltage does not stay the same 

* *Voltage* is a force which makes electrons move through a wire.

*Electricity Introduction*


* Voltage *V*
* Current *A* or *I*
* Resistance *ohms*

V = I * R
R = V/I
I = V/R

*Resistance can be formed in series or in parallel*

### Microprocessor & Microcontroller

* Microprocessor is known as the brain of any computer
---

##### IDE

---

##### Breadboard

---



#### Input Devices & Sensors 

A sensor basically give data to the arduino, it gives information to the controller by changing its voltage

Some examples

*Rotatory Potentiometer: This device would change the resistance it offers if we rotate the knob clockwise or anti-clocwise*

*Momentary Push Button Switch: When we press the switch it will close the circuit and when we release the switch it will open the circuit*

*Sound & Microphone Sensor*
*Touch Sensor*
*Rotary Encoder*
*Ultrasonic Distance Sensor*
*Infrared Sensor*
*Temp & Humidity Sensor*
*Light Dependant Resistor*

### Bits and Bytes

*Calculting bits*

*A bit can store 0 or 1 inside one memory box
*8 bits form a byte
* We can only store value up to the upper limit of that space
*Need to research a bit on binary math ro understand it a bit better*
* In order to calculate how many bits are needed, we multiply by 2

#### Arduino Programming

* Arduino programming uses a mixture of c and c++
* Arduino makers call it wiring 
* Setup and Loop
* Built in functions
* what digitalWrite means is replace the built in function with a certain pin on the arduino board, n.13 for instance
manipulating digital pins through inbuilt functions
Low means 0 voltages which mean light off and high means 5 voltages which means ligh on
*Variables, declared before setup
