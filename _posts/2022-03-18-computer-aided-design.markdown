For this week, I dedicated my time to watching a lot of tutorials, as I set out my learning goals to learn a little bit of blender and fusion 360. As a design goal, I wanted to do a bit of research on biomimicry, *Biomimicry in Architecture* by Micheal Pawlyn (2011) p. 38-43 and got inspired by trees.

## Fusion 360

I watched this course on LinkedIn Learning

Some gathered tips:

Ways of Planning Your Design

* Inside Out - like lego, building blocks, you build on top of it.

* Outside In - like a sculpture, block of clay, carve away final shape from their starting profile.

* Before starting off with a design, taking measurements of the object you would like to model is crucial. A Digital Caliper can help you with precise measurements.

* Sketch on paper and insert the sketch as a reference for your model.
