For this week, I dedicated my time to watching a lot of tutorials, as I set out my learning goals to learn a little bit of blender and fusion 360. As a design goal, I wanted to do a bit of research on biomimicry, *Biomimicry in Architecture* by Micheal Pawlyn (2011) p. 38-43 and got inspired by trees.

## Fusion 360

I watched this course on LinkedIn Learning

Some gathered tips:

Ways of Planning Your Design

* Inside Out - like lego, building blocks, you build on top of it.

* Outside In - like a sculpture, block of clay, carve away final shape from their starting profile.

* Before starting off with a design, taking measurements of the object you would like to model is crucial. A Digital Caliper can help you with precise measurements.

* Sketch on paper and insert the sketch as a reference for your model.

### Getting Inspired by Nature

##### 3D Bodies types : 

A 3D Shape used to add or remove geometry 

* Mesh body - imported as stl or obj, popular among 3D printing platforms 
* Form body - gives more control in pushing and pulling the shapes, once you finish the form it will turn into a surface body

* Solid body

#### Component

A part or a container used within an assembly

### Side Hustle 

Hazal & I prepared some molds by cutting and melting blocks of acrylic then putting them inside containers

Going through last year's fab academy documentation, I really liked this tutorial using Cuttle
<https://fabacademy.org/2021/labs/waag/students/nadieh-bremer/blog/week-3/>

It looks cool because it allows you to prepare complex geometric shapes easily for the laser cutter, it's online and for free!
