1. Turn on computer, take out usb just in case 
2. Make sure your spindle is not going to bump into a screw 
3. Fire extinguisher is in the back 
4. No framing, you have to know dimensions of milling in v carve pro 
5. Example Square 10 * 10 set job size 
6. Set dimensions roughly of design, then I know where I will place my screws 
7. Separate drilling tool pit for bigger pieces 
8. Measure thickness 
9. Zero it at the bottom of the material, except for using wax or with the 3D mole making, put it near the top, waxed or foamed
10. Sacrificial layer 
11. Measuring our square 32.5 and 30.4 till 30.6 put it a bit smaller so 30 * 30 is okay!
12. Y axis is the short direction and x axis is the long one 
13. Zero point axis, bottom left corner (p.o.v) of machine which is my right 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/povcnc.jpg)
*zero it to left side of the machine*

15. Check the material, no screws or anything on it 
16. How many screws you put in check the number 
17. Modelling resolution is Fine, within the software, high 
18. File, import, vectors 
19. Job set in file operations and then press ok 

* Tools to fix, vectors, you can draw something too

20. Edit - select all duplicate vectors and delete them 
21. Transform objects - move 
22. Edit - join vectors option if vcarve says it’s not connected 
23. Different types of join - Join with tolerance, join close vectors with lines, regular join options 
24. Transform - align

25. Press fit test 
26. 5 mm circles for the drilling tool path , the smaller the diameter the longer it takes so 5 is ok, how long your mm is going to be 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Circle_thickness.jpg)


![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/5mm.jpg)
*5 mm two flute end mill, it’s the little edges and because it’s flat it’s an end mill*

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/6mm.jpg)
*6 mm 2 flutes Bull nose means it’s rounded*

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/pne_flute_one_edge.jpg)
*One flute, one edge*

Check the depth 

27. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/drilling_holes.jpg)
*Drilling holes for the screws , 5 * 5*

28. Toolpaths
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/toolpaths.jpg)

* Profile tool path 
* Pocket tool path - Make a pocket out of the inner circle 
* Inner cutting tool paths and outer cutting tool paths
* Engraving will be a pocket so it won’t go all the way through 
*You can generate these tools in whatever way you want but best to follow the order suggested*

----

29. Drilling tool path, don’t cut all the way through 
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/drilling_tool_path.jpg)
*2/3 of the thickness, material might move too much, screw has to hold on to something*

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/start_depth_drilling.jpg)
*Start depth which is 0 (top of material)*

*5 mm Deep except when you are drilling in a pocket then you start with 5 instead of zero*

----

30. Select tool

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/5mm-drill.jpg)

* Fab academy 5 mm end mill
* Spindle speed for wood 18000 and that’s the maximum
* Name your file
* Tool type end mill  
* Drilling tool path end mil 

*Geometry*
* Diameter is 5 
* Cutting parameter 
* Pass depth : depth for every path for every vector 2.5 
Half of the diameter(for 5 it’s 2.5) maximum depth of the material removed 
* Stepover distance be, it takes more time
*For instance 100 means no over lap*
*3D models, roughing and finishing needs a larger step over*
* We went with 30% which is not the best results yet not so bad

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/30%.jpg)

* Feedrate is the speed of the machine, going for 50-60 is a good start for wood with 2 flute end mill, when it comes to foam 100-120 mm per sec is a good speed

* Plunge rate is the speed at which the router bit is driven down into the material when starting a cut and will vary depending on the bit used and the material being processed. 20 is good for our piece of wood

* If you have a file with different milling bits, save them in different files

* Dwell at the bottom - don't really use it 

* Use vectors selection order and select the shapes in the order you wish for them to be cut

31. Press Calculate, this is a very important step then press close.

---

32. Preview toolpath 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Preview Toolpaths.jpg)

* Reset preview - Reset the preview before running.
The toolpath boxes have to be checked to run with Preview Visible Tool Paths. The boxes uncheck when you preview. it will show the order of cutting as well as the depth, for instance to show that the mill will not go all the way through.

---

33. Pocket toolpath

*Pocket milling allows the machinist to use an end mill type cutting tool and machine away large amounts of material in a “Roughing” cycle prior to finishing the part. This saves time and efficiently maximizes the amount of material removal. There are different styles of pocket toolpath that include traditional lace or zig-zag (back and forth), concentric or offset In/Out and high speed cutting paths*

There are three different types of pocket milling 

* Traditional Pocket Toolpath
* Pocket In/Out Toolpath
* High speed pocket milling toolpath

*The settings we used*
1. Fab academy end mill 5 mm from tool list 
2. Cut depth 6 mm start depth 0 
3. Clear pocket 
4. Offset in a spiral fashion concentric 
5. Cut direction doesn’t matter leave on climb 
6. Raster angle 90 degrees because it’s less harsher on the machine then press calculate 
7. Profile pass : Used to clean up the inside edge after machining the pocket. This can be done either before the rastering (First) or after the rastering (Last). last is nicer than in the beginning
8. Advanced settings
* Vector Selection order gives you more control over what you do
* Pocket Allowance : The Pocket Allowance allows you to quickly create a toolpath that will machine the pocket either smaller or larger than the defining closed vector. A Pocket Allowance of 0.0 (the default) will create a pocket the exact size of the defining vector.
9. Close

34. Profile toolpath 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/profile_tool_path.jpg)

* Cute depth 12.4 
* Outside/inside 
* Direction climb 
* Last pass - do separate last pass
* Add tabs to tool path 
* Add manually or automatically but not at corners, manually gives you more control to adjust

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/not-at-corners.jpg)
*Calculate and see what it’s doing*

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/calculate_corner.jpg)

* Then save
*Rename toolpath list

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rename-list.jpg)
*Be aware that one of the objects is not somewhere hiding, don’t copy paste little pieces somewhere hiding*

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/the knot.jpg)
*We have to push it out*

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/push-out.jpg)
*Remove dust*

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/collets.jpg)
*Box with all collets*

*Er 25 diameter* 

* Put collet into nut and it has to give a satisfying click, not to have it loose 

* Milling bit into collet 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/click.jpg)
*Make sure it goes in but not too deep, wraps it up entirely*

* Measure how much it’s coming out 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/measure-click.jpg)
*Don’t try to push the boundaries* 
*If you’re milling into 2D it’s not important* 
*If you’re milling into 3D it is important to keep in mind* 

* Put milling bit into machine 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/milling-bit-machine.jpg)

* Tighten it as tight as you can but not too tight that you can’t take it off again
