**Servo and titl sensor**

** Place the **tilt sensor** on the breadboard, connect the pins, one to the - on the board, keep middle empty, the last to the arduino, one of the digital pins. To know which is ground and which is power, refer back to the manual.

** Then add a resistor with 10 kÎ© connecting from the + side of the tilt sensor 


* Tilt sensor with passive buzzers + adding different tones
* Using the magic cup tilt sensor for lights
